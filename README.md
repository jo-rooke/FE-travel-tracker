# RightTrack

<a rel="Link to the RightTrack site" href="https://jr-travel-tracker.netlify.app/">Check out the live site</a>

Going on a well-deserved post lockdown holiday? Packing it all in to go on that once-in-a-lifetime travelling spree? Or just making a journey you want to let your loved ones know about? 
Use RightTrack to plan out, share, and alert your friends and family to progress on your trip. It can be chaotic to have to text everyone you know every time you have an update, but we allow you to send automated emails at the click of a button with all the itinerary detail of the stop youve reached

## Features
### Your Profile
- See a collection of all the trips you've taken
- Keep track of who your saved contacts are - you can delete or just disable them if you need.
- Alert all your saved contacts that you are safe, in case of urgent emergency, this sends them your last logged activity so they are updated until you can reach them yourself.
### Add a Trip
- Create a new trip and add all the details for each stop
- You can add specific contacts to a trip, so you only alert the people you want to
### View a Trip
- To remind yourself of your itinerary
- Edit trips you've already saved, in case there are changes to your plans 

## Roadmap
This project is currently under development. I am open to collaborators. Features planned to be under construction in the future include:
- Add user authentication 
- Add friending options to see others' trips
- Micro tracking: for small but riskier journeys, a feature with a countdown until arrival that triggers an alert if not arrived or delayed by user, a dominant button over the screen to alert contacts something is wrong (rather than 'I'm safe).
- Adding images, videos, textual reflections and other rich media to stops, serves as a journal
